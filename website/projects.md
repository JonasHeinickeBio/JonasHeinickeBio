# Projects

Welcome to my projects showcase! Here are the key projects I've been working on in bioinformatics and software development.

## 🔬 Featured Projects

### PyEuropePMC
[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyeuropepmc.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pyeuropepmc/)
[![Python 3.10+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**Technologies**: Python, REST APIs, RDF, Knowledge Graphs  
**Description**: A comprehensive Python toolkit for automated search, extraction, and analysis of scientific literature from Europe PMC. This is my flagship project for working with biomedical literature data.

**Key Features**:
- Advanced search API with query builder
- Full-text retrieval (PDF, XML, HTML)
- XML parsing and conversion to multiple formats
- Knowledge graph generation with RDF support
- External API enrichment (CrossRef, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex)
- Analytics and visualizations
- 200+ tests with 90%+ code coverage

**Impact**: 5 stars on GitHub, published on PyPI with comprehensive documentation
